DIP assignment README

Tuomas Ilvonen 240160 & Tommi Parviainen 234093


In this assignment, we have completed the following features:
- basic solution
- dirty data parser
- third dimension

Third dimension is represented in the results as dates, not seasons, because dates give more information.

You can enable/disable third dimension by changing the boolean value at the start of 'Class Flickr extends Serializable'.

If you have any questions, we're happy to help: tuomas.ilvonen@student.tut.fi, tommi.parviainen@student.tut.fi
